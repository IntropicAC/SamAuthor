          <h1>About Sam</h1>
          <p class="aboutMe">
            I'm a budding writer from Manchester, England. Growing up, I had a
            bit of a rocky journey with my mental health. It was tough, but I
            learned a lot from those experiences. I started writing what later
            turned into my first book when I was 14, primarily because I felt
            like I just didn't fit in with the world around me. Writing down my
            thoughts and ideas was like therapy for me, a way to make sense of
            things. And when I shared them with a few mates, they found it
            helpful too. That's when I realised that my early struggles weren't
            just obstacles; they were tools I could use to help others through
            my writing.<br><br> I initially began writing nonfiction and after releasing
            ‘Alienated’ decided to begin writing fiction. I decided to make this
            change not only to help depict my message further through characters
            such as in Robin’s Bench but also to be able to be more expressive
            of my ideas through the boundless world of fiction writing. All my
            life I have wanted to help others in whichever way I can, I have
            worked in mental health services, the probation service and also
            children’s care homes. <br><br>I'm on a mission to make a positive
            difference with my words, especially for those who feel out of place
            in this world, to show them they're not alone. I know what it's like
            to hit rock bottom, and I want to spread the word that there's
            always a way out. Sometimes it can be as simple as having a new way
            of looking at life.

              Alienated is a powerful, thought-provoking book that offers a new
              lens to view the world through. It is packed with eye-opening
              perspectives and actionable wisdom to give the reader a clearer
              vision while navigating life’s complexities. This book challenges
              the world you thought you knew, using fascinating metaphors to
              deconstruct the world around us. The author also provides insights
              into his journey and past hardships that have molded the
              perspective he now holds.<br /><br />
              Sam speaks about how he spent a lot of his life dealing with a
              continual sense of separation from everybody else, like he saw
              things in human nature that his peers never did. He never seemed
              to find his place, worrying that a complete change of character
              was necessary for acceptance. This vicious pattern of thought
              eventually led him to wander alone down a dark mental path with
              seemingly no way out.<br /><br />

              He eventually switched his approach, from the ceaseless
              desperation of acceptance to embracing that very feeling of
              Alienation he has carried all along. It was from this point that
              he found fulfillment in his life. The only right thing to do was
              to spread his insights to readers around the world. Readers who
              may be currently wandering down that same dark path feeling like
              they have no place to fit in. This book might be the perfect
              solution to finding a deep connection to life despite feeling
              Alienated.

              disconnected to embracing his sense of alienation, ultimately
              finding fulfillment. This thought-provoking book provides readers
              with a new lens to navigate life's complexities, offering solace
